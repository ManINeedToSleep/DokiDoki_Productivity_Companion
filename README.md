# Welcome to the DDLC Productivity Club! 💝

*Just Monika... helping you stay productive!*

Hey there! Welcome to our special little club where literature meets productivity! 📚✨ Unlike the original Literature Club, we're here to help you study and stay focused - no unexpected plot twists, I promise! (*nervous laughter*) 

## What Makes Our Club Special? 

Remember how supportive our favorite club members were? Well, now they're here to help you with your productivity journey! Each Doki brings their own special touch to your study sessions:

### 🎀 Your Study Companions
- **Sayori**: Brings cheerful encouragement and helps you maintain a positive study mindset!
- **Yuri**: Offers calm, focused study environments and deep concentration techniques
- **Natsuki**: Keeps you energized with short, intense study bursts (and maybe some manga breaks!)
- **Monika**: Tracks your progress and adjusts your study plan... (just don't let her near your files 😅)

### ✨ Club Activities (Features)

#### 📝 Study Tools
- **Literature-Inspired Pomodoro Timer**: Break your study sessions into manageable chunks
- **Poem-Like Progress Tracking**: Watch your daily achievements build like verses
- **Character-Based Statistics**: Let your favorite Doki track your progress
- **Achievement Poems**: Unlock special messages as you maintain your study streak!

#### 🌸 Club Member System
- Choose your study companion (they're all really excited to help!)
- Receive personalized encouragement based on your study patterns
- Dynamic interactions that evolve with your progress (nothing weird this time, we swear!)

#### 🔐 Club Membership (Authentication)
- Create your own club member profile
- Sign in with email or Google
- Your progress is safely stored (in a normal database, not in any suspicious .chr files)
